# Portal 充能

> 随着时间的变化，Portal 上 Resonator 的能量逐渐减弱，为了保持 Portal 的所有权，我们需要通过充能将我们的 XM 能量转移到 Portal 上。

充能主要利用于床 po、战略 po、以及一些补给 po

根据 AP 获得效率，不建议向没有特殊用途的 Portal 充能

每次成功充能获得 10AP

### 一般充能

站在 Portal 可控制范围内，进入 Portal 菜单充能

能量转移率：100%


### 远程充能

持有充能目标 Portal 的 Portal Key，从 Key 列表中进入充能

玩家的等级决定最远的远程充能距离，计算公式为：

`最远充能距离 (km) = 玩家等级 x 250`

等级与最远远程充能距离计算公式为：

|等级|距离（km）|
|--|--|
|01|250|
|02|500|
|03|750|
|04|1000|
|05|1250|
|06|1500|
|07|1750|
|08|2000|
|09|2250|
|10|2500|
|11|2750|
|12|3000|
|13|3250|
|14|3500|
|15|4750|
|16|4000|


能量转移率与 Portal 和玩家之间的距离呈负相关，当能量转换率低于50%时则不能充能，公式如下：

`能量转移率 (%) = 1 - Portal与玩家距离(km)/(500*玩家等级) `

能量转换率与等级间的关系如下图（以50公里为一单位距离）：

|距离(千米)\等级|一级|二级|三级|四级|五级|六级|七级|八级|九级|十级|十一级|十二级|十三级|十四级|十五级|十六级
